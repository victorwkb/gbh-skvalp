# MLAI Green Battery Hack - Team Skvalp

## Competition Overview

The goal of [MLAI Green Battery Hack](https://www.mlai.au/hackathon) is to develop a strategy to optimise battery operations within an energy market simulation. Our challenge is to create algorithms, or policies, that expertly manage batery charging and discharging in response to real-time market data and incoming energy from a simulated solar panel.

## Accomplishments

We are proud to have achieved a final ranking of **4th place** in the competition amongst the many teams formed in Melbourne and Sydney. Our team, Skvalp, have incorporated a similar approach as the 1st place winners team, which will be discussed in the following [section](#strategy-overview). Due to some technical issues, we had to disable a function in order for our algorithm to work properly in the final leaderboard simulation, which resulted in a lower score than expected. However, we are proud of our team's efforts and the final result as the process was very rewarding for me.

## Our Approach
Disclaimer: As some of our team members are working on a start-up company, due to proprietary reasons, I have removed some of the code and details used in our strategy. However, I will still provide a high-level explanation of the functionalities of the redacted code.
